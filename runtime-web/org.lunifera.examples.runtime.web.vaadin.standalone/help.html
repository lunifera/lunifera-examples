	<h3>Set the target platform</h3>
	Target platform are all bundles required to run the example. They are
	getting loaded by P2-repositories. Please open
	org.lunifera.examples.runtime.web.vaadin.standalone.target and wait
	until target platform was resolved. If any errors are shown use the
	update button at the right side of the target definition editor.
	Therefore select the failing P2 repo and click update.
	<p>When the target definition was resolved (no task is running in
		eclipse and target definition editor shows features of P2-repos) click
		"Set as target platform"-button. This will install all bundles and
		build the workspace.
	<h3>Launch application</h3>
	To launch the application, open "Launch Configurations". Therefore
	select the litte triangle right of "Run as..."-button. You will find a
	launchconfig called "vaadinstandalone". Select it an press "validate
	bundles". If errors are shown use the "add required bundles" button to
	add all missing bundles to launchconfig. Press "validate bundles" again. Everything should be fine.
	<p>
	Press launch and vaadin should start.
